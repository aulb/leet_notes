# Linked List Cycle II
*TODO*

# Merge Two Sorted Lists
Remember that the list is sorted, once one run out, that means the rest can just be tacked on.
Example:
1) 1,2,3  2) 2,5,6
1->2->2->3, 5->6

# Remove Nth Node From End of List
The "one pass" algorithm is advancing fast pointer `n` steps. Keep advancing slow and fast pointers
until it hits a null. When it hits a null, the slow pointer would be at the `n`th from behind.

# Merge K Sorted List
From now on: Use Python3! 3.8+
Priority queue is useful. Remember the usual pattern (priority, item).
Learn about how the insert works. Learn about heaps. Insert in heaps, heapify method.
