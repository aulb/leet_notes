# Coin Change
Tushar Roy is the man.

# Climbing Stairs
Fibonacci.

# Longest Increasing Subsequence
Watch Tushar.

# Longest Common Subsequence
Watch Tushar.

# Unique Path
Watch out for the edges.

# Unique Path II
Watch out for gotcha! cases. Start is blocked, pathway around start is blocked, end is blocked.

# Longest Increasing Subsequence
[Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE2b_-XfVDk) O(n^2).
O(nlogn) is possible, patience sort algorithm (a little convoluted).

# Longest Common Subsequence
[Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnD96abizww) O(nm) space and runtime.

# Word Break
Quick reminder:
"leetcode", ["leet", "ee", "code"], lookup@final = [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]
"ee" is not true at index 2 because its not the beginning nor "l" can be made.
"leet" is true because its in the beginning of the string

# Decode Ways
This is like climbing stairs. If the current number is 1 - 9 carry over from previous case. If the number is between 10 - 26, a divergent path (add two steps)
