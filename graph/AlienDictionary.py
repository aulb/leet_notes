# There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.
# Example 1:
# [
#   "wrt",
#   "wrf",
#   "er",
#   "ett",
#   "rftt"
# ]
# The correct order is wertf

# In a normal dictionary, azd is before zad
