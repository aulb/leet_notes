# Merge Intervals
Sort by `start`. Merge by always taking highest `end`. Push when `prev.end` is lesser than `curr.start`.

# Non Overlapping Intervals
"Given a collection of intervals, find the maximum number of intervals that are non-overlapping." (the classic Greedy problem: Interval Scheduling)
